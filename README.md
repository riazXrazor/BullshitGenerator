# BullshitGenerator

Occasionally some Chinese characters are needed for test text rendering during GUI development. __ This project only does this, please do not use it for any other purposes __.

Needs to generate some texts to test if my GUI rendering codes good or not. so I made this.

This project is a python3 version, and the online version is modified by suulnnka, which is more convenient to use:

Next plan:
1. Prevent articles from being overly duplicated
1. Add more words.
1. Join the content of Ma Sanli <Meeting Fan>
1. Add the ability to directly render the image by handwriting (__ is only used to test whether my printer is working properly, please do not use it with __).

## About Pull requests:

Every request will be read carefully, but because there are more things in the near future, merge may not be timely. After all, it is an amateur project. Please forgive me. If the future is not updated in time, people with lofty ideals are welcome to continue this project.

## About Chinese variable name:

Usually, the code is not written in Chinese variable names. The Chinese variable name in this project is only the beginning of the writing. When writing the code while writing the code, I am too lazy to cut the English input method. But keep it!

## About generating algorithms

Talent is too shallow to learn any algorithm related to natural language processing. At present, it prefers a simple and effective way to achieve the purpose. Unless it hits the ceiling, it will not introduce any algorithm such as neural network for the time being. , a better algorithm. But unless the effect is grouped, the monks will not merge for the time being.
